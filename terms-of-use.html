        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Eagles18 mobile application ("App").</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms and that the Terms form a binding legal agreement between you—whether acting individually or on behalf of an entity—and the App, governing all aspects of your use of the App. If you do not agree with all of the legal terms, then you are prohibited from using the App and you must discontinue use immediately.</p>

        <p>The Eagles18 App is designed for personal use by individual golfers in the European Union (EU). It provides tools for score tracking, handicap calculations, and performance analytics via iOS and Apple Watch devices.</p>

        <p>Additional rules, guidelines, or documents that Eagles 18 may publish in connection with the App are automatically part of these Legal Terms and apply to your use of the App.</p>

        <p>Eagles 18 may change these Legal Terms at any time, including to reflect updates to the Services, legal requirements, or internal policies, and may do so without prior notice to you. By continuing to access or use the Services after an updated version is made available, you confirm that you accept and agree to be bound by the then-current Legal Terms. Eagles 18 may indicate revisions by updating the "Last updated" date or by using any other reasonable method of publication, and is not obligated to send you individual notifications about each change. You are solely responsible for reviewing the Legal Terms on a regular basis so that you remain aware of the terms that govern your use of the App.</p>

        <p>If you continue to use the App after changes take effect, your use will be treated as your consent to, and acceptance of, all amended terms; if you do not agree with any update, you must immediately stop using the App. For your convenience, you should keep a saved or printed copy of the current version of these Legal Terms for your records.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>2. Operator Information</h2>

        <p>Jurisdiction: Stade, Niedersachsen, Germany</p>

        <p>The App is currently available for use only within Germany. The App must not be distributed or made available in any country where doing so would violate local laws or regulations, or would require Eagles 18 to satisfy registration, licensing, or similar regulatory obligations. If individuals choose to access or use the App from outside Germany, they do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for determining and complying with all laws that apply in their location.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="eligibility">
        <h2>3. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
        <p>The App is available to users of all ages, including those under 13, for personal use. For users under 16 years old, processing of personal data relies on parental consent or authorization as required by Article 8 GDPR and German law (digital consent age: 16).</p>

        <p>If you are under 16, you represent that you have obtained verifiable parental or guardian consent for account creation and data processing. We make reasonable efforts to verify parental responsibility where required.</p>

        <p>Authentication occurs via your Google account. By linking your account, you permit us to collect and store relevant authentication information, profile data, and scores in Firebase (Google Cloud, Germany). All account information is handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy, including enhanced protections for children's data.</p>

You receive a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes only. Our content is protected by copyright and trademark laws. Any breach of these Intellectual Property rights will lead to a termination of your account.</p>

        <p>You may not reproduce, modify, distribute, transmit, display, or create derivative works based on any part of the App unless explicitly authorized by Eagles18.</p>

        <p>By submitting feedback, questions, comments, ideas, or other content to us, you agree to transfer all intellectual property rights in such submissions to Eagles18. We may use, reproduce, or distribute these submissions freely, without any obligation to acknowledge or compensate you.</p>

    <section id="withdrawal">
        <h2>8. Right of Withdrawal</h2>
        <p>You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.</p>

        <p>To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us (P.K. Schmidbauer, <a href="mailto:p.k.schmidbauer@gmail.com">p.k.schmidbauer@gmail.com</a>) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g., a letter sent via email). You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory.</p>

        <p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>

        <p>Effects of withdrawal: If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>

        <p>For digital services (such as app subscriptions), your right of withdrawal expires prematurely if we have provided digital content or digital services that are not supplied on a tangible medium and you have expressly consented to our beginning of performance during the withdrawal period and have confirmed that you understand that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal upon commencement of performance. If applicable, you may be required to pay an amount that is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated your withdrawal from this contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</p>
